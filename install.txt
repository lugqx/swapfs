Copy the driver (swapfs.sys) to %systemroot%\system32\drivers\.

The drivers in the sys\obj directory are compiled for Windows XP
(and all later versions of Windows) while the drivers in the sys\Debug
and sys\Release directories are compiled for Windows 10 and testsigned
with a SHA-2 signature.

(chk is the debug version, fre is the normal version,
i386 is for 32-bit systems and amd64 is for 64-bit systems)

Edit swapfs.reg for your Linux swap partition and drive letter.
/dev/sda1 in Linux = \\Device\\Harddisk0\\Partition1 in Windows, an extended
partition is skipped in the enumeration, a full disk is refered to as Partition0.
The driver can use up to nine swap partitions.

Import swapfs.reg to the Registry.

Reboot. If using an unsigned driver and running on the 64-bit version
of Windows press F8 and select "Disable driver signature enforcement".
On later versions of Windows this boot setting can be reached by holding
down shift before clicking restart.

The drivers are testsigned, you can allow Windows to load testsigned drivers
with the command "bcdedit /set testsigning on".
